## Overview

Traktor Bridge is a professional-grade application that converts Native Instruments Traktor collections (.nml files) to Pioneer Rekordbox format. Originally developed as a command-line tool (CLI) - a vestige from my Amiga CLI heritage - it has been refactored to include a modern graphical interface while preserving CLI usage for advanced users.

**Design Philosophy**: The code is clean but not perfect; certain areas could be optimized. The monolithic code structure is intentional to facilitate usage by non-programmers who prefer a single-file solution.

The application supports both database (.pdb) and XML export formats, making it compatible with Pioneer CDJ players and various DJ software that accept Rekordbox libraries.

- `djmdSongPlaylist`: Track-playlist relationships
- `djmdCue`: Cue point data
- `djmdBeatGrid`: Beat grid information
- `djmdArtwork`: Album artwork

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "NML Parse Error"
**Cause**: Corrupted or unsupported NML file format  
**Solution**: 
- Ensure Traktor is closed when accessing the NML file
- Try exporting a fresh collection from Traktor
- Check file isn't corrupted

#### "File Not Found" During Conversion
**Cause**: Music files moved since last Traktor scan  
**Solution**:
- Set the Music Root Folder to your current music location
- The smart cache will locate moved files automatically

#### "Missing Dependencies" Error
**Cause**: Required Python packages not installed  
**Solution**:
```bash
pip install PySide6 pygame tinytag pillow mutagen
```

#### Audio Preview Not Working
**Cause**: Audio system conflicts or missing codecs  
**Solution**:
- Restart the application
- Check system audio settings
- Install additional audio codecs if needed

### Performance Optimization

#### Large Collections (>10,000 tracks)
- Use Music Root Folder for faster file location
- Process playlists in smaller batches
- Ensure sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended)

#### Network Storage
- Copy NML file locally before processing
- Map network drives persistently
- Use wired connections for better stability
